**Goal of the Project: We need high-quality tutorials that will give a clear guide to our newcomers or beginners in open source space.**

**Things to keep in mind before recording the video:**
 - Ensure your environment is calm and quiet, and background noise is at a minimum
 - You should record in a relaxed voice and with a clear tone
 - Recordings should have a transcript, so if you are not working from a pre-written script, make sure transcription is turned on when you record.
 - Prior to recording, you will need to [reserve a block of time on the CHAOSS Zoom channel](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ0cfidJRNCmYcfleLaIHPdeM4udps9EaTjhK02QKOGP8sLxRGo1XTxmr6l2C3ubItiI_U7Zlo-4) for recording. Blocks of time may be reserved in 30-minute increments. 
   
**Guidelines for video recording:**

- Planning: Define your topic and outline the content you want to cover. We have a list of topics here, but you will be assigned a topic based on your interest.
- Scripting: Write a script or outline to guide your presentation. [Use this sample guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xl5Mi0YKTF-hr44Wf7TK3Zv5bKARw_eY6PERx2YVr0M/edit) and [this is a template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jIee4PRQsjF4_nDBxNOcbAxeQ1WA0w5HKOlRc3wdR34/edit). If you are only recording the video, a script will be provided for you.
- Creating Slides: If you are creating slides for your presentation, [use this template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t_oBQhMAtZvvsqTppRj96fbjpokakjiZOdtWIO3NIdY/edit#slide=id.g224756f3bb6_1_0) for a consistent look across our video collection. [Check out this sample](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yRONCzo0hP0xl-K-5ZDmeM_4wX7xHosZcc6dQic1gJ8/preview) before you start
- Gathering Equipment: Ensure you have a good-quality camera, microphone, and lighting.
- Setting Up: Choose a quiet, well-lit location with a clean background.
- Recording: You will use the [CHAOSS Zoom](https://zoom.us/my/chaoss) and the recording will start automatically. Begin speaking, following your script or outline.
